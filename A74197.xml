            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I A. B.</hi> Do truly and ſincerely acknowledge, profeſs, teſtifie &amp; declare in my conſcience before God and the world, that our Soveraign Lord <hi>King <hi>Charles</hi>
               </hi> is lawfull and rightfull <hi>King</hi> of this Realm, and of all other his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Dominions and Countries; and that the Pope, neither of himſelf, nor by any authority of the Church or Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> or by any other means with any other, hath any power or authority to depoſe the <hi>King,</hi> or to diſpoſe any of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Kingdomes or Dominions, or to authorize any Forraign Prince to invade or annoy him or his Countries, or to diſcharge any of his Subiects of their Allegiance and obedience to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> or to give licenſe or leave to any of them to bear Arms, raiſe Tumults, or to offer any violence or hurt to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Royal Perſon, State or Government, or to any of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Subiects within his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>Alſo I do ſwear from my heart, that notwithſtanding any Declaration or ſentence of Excommunication or Deprivation made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope or his Succeſſors, or by any Authority derived or pretended to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him or his Sea, againſt the ſaid <hi>King,</hi> his Heirs or Succeſſors, or any Abſolution of the ſaid Subiects from their Obedience; I will bear faith and true Allegiance to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,</hi> his Heirs and Succeſſors, and him and them will defend to the uttermoſt of my power, againſt all conſpiracies and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts whatſoever which ſhall be made againſt his or their Perſons, their Crown and Dignitie, by reaſon or colour of any ſuch Sentence or Declaration or otherwiſe; and will doe my beſt endeavour to diſcloſe and make known unto his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> his Heirs and Succeſſors, all Treaſons and Traiterous Conſpiracies which I ſhall know or hear of, to be againſt him or any of them.</p>
            <p>And I do further ſwear, That I do from my heart abhor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and abiure, as impious and heretical, this damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Poſition, That Princes which be excommunicated or deprived by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthered by their Subiects, or any other whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And I do beleeve and in conſcience am reſolved, that neither the Pope nor any perſon whatſoever hath power to abſolve me of this Oath, or any part thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full Authority to be lawfully adminiſtred unto me, and do renounce all pardons and diſpenſations to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And all theſe things I do plainly and ſincerely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſwear according to theſe expreſs words by me ſpoken, and according to the plain and common ſenſe and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſame words, without any equivocation, or mental evaſion, or ſecret reſervation whatſoever: And I do make this Recognition and acknowledgment heartily, willingly and truly, upon the true faith of a Chriſtian. <hi>So help me God, &amp;c.</hi>
